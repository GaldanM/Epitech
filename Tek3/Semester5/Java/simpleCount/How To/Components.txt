Which components :

I got inspired by the Windows calculator which provide a similar graphical interface.

I used two JPanel, one for the buttons and one for the displays, of course there is a "root" JPanel to manage both JPanel.

Displays are JTextField that are not editable.

Buttons are JButtons with Listeners.
