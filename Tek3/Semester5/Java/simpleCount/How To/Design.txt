How it works :

OptiCalc is a simple scientific calcultator. You can use both numeric pad or buttons in the graphic interface.

There are two displays :

	- the one on the top show the actual operation so can remember the number you previously entered, 
	- the bottom one shows the actual number you're writting.

"Enter" key is used as "equal", you can only use it when both numbers and the operator are correct.

It only manages numbers with 17 digits, it also manages the floating numbers.
