What about the conception ?

The conception of OptiCalc is pretty simple. As Swing allow to easily build a graphical interface and link it to a class, I create the CalcWindow class that extends from JFrame.

This class will contains all the widgets that OptiCalc need to work properly (JPanel, JButtons, JtextField...)

Some JButtons are bind to a key thanks to InputMap and ActionMap classes.

For each widget, there is a listener which make the code really simple to read. I also created some genereic function for, for example, the numeric listeners or operator listeners.

Displays are formatted by using the getFormattedString method which take a string as parameter and return a string that has a space every third digit (not for digit on decimal part).

Decimal numbers are displayed with the perfect precision thanks to DecimalFormat class which allow to "parse" our floating number and remove unnecessary zeros.

You can only enter seventeen digits, else, OptiCalc will beep.

Thanks for using OptiCalc !
